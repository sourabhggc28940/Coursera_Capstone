On a sunny island, a woman named Lana relaxed under a large umbrella, sipping a cool drink. The peaceful waves contrasted with her busy life in the city, where skyscrapers towered around her every day. She pulled out her credit card to pay for another round of drinks when suddenly, a figure caught her eye. It was her doppelganger, a mirror image of herself, strolling along the beach.

Startled, Lana quickly grabbed her laptop and began researching strange phenomena. As she typed away, a melodious tune drifted in the air—it was a man playing the piano near the shore, accompanied by a cactus in a pot, oddly enough.

In her haste to investigate, she nearly tripped over a basketball lying next to a wobbly pudding stand. She decided to clear her mind with a swim in the nearby pool. As she floated, pondering the mysteries of the universe, a shadow loomed overhead.

She looked up, astonished to see a massive dragon soaring above the island. It let out a thunderous roar, circling once before disappearing into the clouds. 

Lana blinked, unsure if any of it was real, but she knew one thing for sure—this vacation was anything but ordinary.
